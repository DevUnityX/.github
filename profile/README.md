# DevUnity

**DevUnity is not a club. Not a society. We are a student developer team.**  
A place for student devs to grow by building like real professionals — not by looping tutorials or shipping fake projects, but by solving real problems through real teamwork.

> **We don’t just “learn to code.” We build like we’re already in the industry.**

## 💡 Our Vision

DevUnity is a collective of students across universities — NWU, UJ, Wits, and beyond — who are tired of learning in silos. We’re building an ecosystem where students don’t wait for internships to get real experience.

We run DevUnity like a tech company:
- Real projects, real teams
- GitHub collaboration and version control
- Stand-ups, PRs, code reviews, deadlines
- Ownership and accountability
- Mentorship and peer learning

This is about **building tools**, **launching apps**, and **owning the outcome** — as students.

## 🔎 Who We're Looking For

- Student developers (any level) who want to grow by doing
- Designers who want to build UI/UX that people use
- Testers and QA thinkers
- Product-minded contributors
- Curious people who value teamwork, growth, and contribution

Whether you're a beginner hungry to learn or an experienced student looking to lead, **you belong here** if you're serious about building.

## 🧭 Our Values

- **Build, don't just learn** – We prioritize shipping over perfection.
- **Team > Individual** – You grow best when surrounded by driven peers.
- **Progress over prestige** – We value effort and improvement more than titles or tech flexing.
- **Accountability** – If you commit, you follow through.
- **Purpose-driven** – We don't build for the sake of building — we solve problems.

## 📜 Rules & Culture

> We're not strict — but we are serious.

- ✅ **Show up** – If you're on a project team, be reliable.
- 🔁 **Give and receive feedback** – Pull requests, design critique, and collaboration are how we grow.
- 📆 **Stand-ups and async updates** – We communicate, even if it's brief.
- 🛠️ **Use Git properly** – Learn it, respect it, use it.
- 🧠 **Ask for help** – We’re here to support one another, not compete.
- 💬 **Respect everyone** – No toxic behavior. We're all students trying to level up.
